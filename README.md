# dna-storage

This repository contains the code for my Master's project on encoding schemes for archival DNA data storage.

**Title: *Decreasing error-rates in archival DNA data storage through constraint-driven encoding.***

**Research Question:** Can an FSM-based constraint-driven encoding scheme as presented by [Sella *et al.*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465332.3470880) be leveraged to mitigate errors which arise in the archival DNA data storage life-cycle?
